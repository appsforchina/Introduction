# Introduction
What we're about

We are group for software engineers interested in building apps and services for China.  
We'll talk about all aspects of building tech for China, from wechat mini-programs, integrating with Alipay / Wechat pay, devops cloud hosting challenges, UI design differences inside and outside China, and more.  

This is a new group, so we're still trying to figure out what format / venue best fits. Suggestions are welcome!
